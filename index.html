    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading 6</h6>

    <!-- Paragraphs -->
    <p> This is a paragraph tag, this is what it looks like. you can do 
        lorem and the press tab and it will give you dummy text if you 
        would like to fill in your paragraph. I didnt though. So now I 
        will add a <strong> strong tag</strong> this makes the words bold. 
        And the <em>emphesis tag by default makes words italitized.</em>
        next we will do a line break tag. <br> And here it is, see how 
        we went to a new line in the middle of a paragraph. underneath here 
        we have the horizontal rule tag. this tag will give us a line. 
    </p>

    <!-- horizontal rule tag, this tag gives us a line -->
    <hr>

    <p> <del>this is how you do a strike through in your code with the del tag</del></p>
